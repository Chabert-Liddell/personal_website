I did my PhD in applied mathematics and statistics at the [MIA Paris](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris) laboratory under the supervision of [Sophie Donnet](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris/Equipes/Membres/Sophie-Donnet) and [Pierre Barbillon](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris/Equipes/Membres/Pierre-Barbillon). My research focus on the modeling and the inference of networks. Fields of application arise in ecology and sociology.
