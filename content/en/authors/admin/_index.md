I am a postdoctoral researcher at INRAE working on deep learning and network inference methods to analyze trajectory data, with  applications to fishery science.
I did my PhD in applied mathematics and statistics at the [MIA Paris](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris) laboratory under the supervision of [Sophie Donnet](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris/Equipes/Membres/Sophie-Donnet) and [Pierre Barbillon](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris/Equipes/Membres/Pierre-Barbillon) for which I was awarded the Prix Marie-Jeanne Laurent-Duhamel 2024 by the French Statistical Society. My research focus on the modeling and the inference of networks. Fields of application arise in social and life sciences.
