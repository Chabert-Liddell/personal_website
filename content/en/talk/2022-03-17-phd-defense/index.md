abstract: This thesis deals with the development of statistical methods for the analysis
  of collections of interaction networks through three original contributions. Interaction
  networks are a natural way to represent in graph form the exchanges or relationships
  existing between a set of nodes representing species or individuals. Considering
  collections of networks allows to study heterogeneous systems, composed of several
  kinds of interactions involving different types of nodes. When the different networks
  of the collection are linked by a hierarchical relationship, we speak of multilevel
  networks. The stochastic block model has proven its relevance to model the heterogeneity
  of the behavior of nodes in a single network. Extensions to collections of networks
  and to multilevel networks are proposed. They allow to obtain a clustering of the
  nodes of the networks according to their role in the ecosystem or social system,
  and to summarize the structure of the system at the mesoscopic scale through a small
  number of parameters. The inference of these models is complex and variational methods
  are adapted for this purpose. Model selection methods are also used to determine
  the dependence between levels for multilevel networks and the similarity between
  structures for collections of networks. A last part of this thesis proposes a new
  method to study the robustness of ecological interaction networks. Each network
  is modeled by a probabilistic model whose parameters represent the network structure.
  This allows to make the link between the structure of the ecosystem and its robustness,
  but also to compare the robustness of a collection of networks and to correct the
  robustness of a network whose sampling would be incomplete. The developed methods
  are implemented in R packages and applied on data from social sciences and ecology.
