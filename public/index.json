Interaction networks are a natural way to represent in graph form the exchanges or relationships existing between a set of nodes representing species or individuals. Considering collections of networks allows to study heterogeneous systems, composed of several kinds of interactions involving different types of nodes. When the different networks of the collection are linked by a hierarchical relationship, we speak of multilevel networks. The stochastic block model has proven its relevance to model the heterogeneity of the behavior of nodes in a single network. Extensions to collections of networks and to multilevel networks are proposed. They allow to obtain a clustering of the nodes of the networks according to their role in the ecosystem or social system, and to summarize the structure of the system at the mesoscopic scale through a small number of parameters. The inference of these models is complex and variational methods are adapted for this purpose. Model selection methods are also used to determine the dependence between levels for multilevel networks and the similarity between structures for collections of networks. A last part of this thesis proposes a new method to study the robustness of ecological interaction networks. Each network is modeled by a probabilistic model whose parameters represent the network structure. This allows to make the link between the structure of the ecosystem and its robustness, but also to compare the robustness of a collection of networks and to correct the robustness of a network whose sampling would be incomplete. The developed methods are implemented in R packages and applied on data from social sciences and ecology.","tags":["Bipartite networks","Collection of networks","Ecology","Multilevel network","Sociology","Stochastic Block Model"],"title":"Statistical learning of collections of networks with applications in ecology and sociology","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1646329706,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646329706,"objectID":"f25e70d13ea70df752496da1097dc16e","permalink":"https://www.chabert-liddell.com/talk/eusn/","publishdate":"2022-03-03T18:48:26+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/eusn/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Stochastic Block Model","Collection of networks","Sociology","Advice network","Social network"],"title":"A Stochastic Block Model for collection of networks: Do the networks share a common structure?

It corresponds to the proportion of species that are disconnected from the rest of the network when extinctions occur sequentially. Classically, the robustness is calculated for a given network, from the simulation of a large number of extinction sequences. The link between network structure and robustness remains an open question. Setting a joint probabilistic model on the network and the extinction sequences allows analysis of this relation. Bipartite stochastic block models have proven their ability to model bipartite networks for example, plant-pollinator networks: species are divided into blocks and interaction probabilities are determined by the blocks of membership. Analytical expressions of the expectation and variance of robustness are obtained under this model, for different distributions of primary extinction sequences. The impact of the network structure on the robustness is analyzed through a set of properties and numerical illustrations. The analysis of a collection of bipartite ecological networks allows us to compare the empirical approach to our probabilistic approach, and illustrates the relevance of the latter when it comes to computing the robustness of a partially observed or incompletely sampled network.

The levels are linked by an affiliation relationship, each individual belonging to a unique organization. A new Stochastic Block Model is proposed as a unified probabilistic framework tailored for multilevel networks. This model contains latent blocks accounting for heterogeneity in the patterns of connection within each level and introducing dependencies between the levels. The sought connection patterns are not specified a priori which makes this approach flexible. Variational methods are used for the model inference and an Integrated Classified Likelihood criterion is developed for choosing the number of blocks and also for deciding whether the two levels are dependent or not. A comprehensive simulation study exhibits the benefit of considering this approach, illustrates the robustness of the clustering and highlights the reliability of the criterion used for model selection. This approach is applied on a sociological dataset collected during a television program trade fair, the inter-organizational level being the economic network between companies and the inter-individual level being the informal network between their representatives. It brings a synthetic representation of the two networks unraveling their intertwined structure and confirms the coopetition at stake.
